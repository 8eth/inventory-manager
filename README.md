# Inventory Manager

This app is an inventory tracking application for a logistics company built using Ruby on Rails and it is hosted on replit. 

# How to access the deployed app

To view and interact with inventory items, go to https://inventory-manager.bethfekadu.repl.co/items
To view and interact with warehouses, go to https://inventory-manager.bethfekadu.repl.co/warehouses

# How to run the app on your local machine

After cloning down the repo from GitHub, run `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed` then run `rails s` in your terminal. Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view and interact with the app.

## How to run the app from the Replit file

Go to https://replit.com/@BethFekadu/inventory-manager#app/views/items/_item.html.erb and hit run. You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Running commands

Start every command with `bundle exec` so that it runs in the context of the installed gems environment. The console pane will give you output from the server but you can run arbitrary command from the shell without stopping the server.
